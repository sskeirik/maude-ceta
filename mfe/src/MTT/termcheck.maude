fmod TERMINATION-CHECK is
  pr BOOL .
  pr INT .
  pr STRING .
  pr QID .
  pr QID-LIST .

*** First parameter: keywork for the external tool
*** Second parameter: expression to be checked
***                   A temporary file is created containing the expression
***                   and the file is passed as argument to the tool.
*** Third parameter: Maximum number of miliseconds for the computation
*** Result: Resulting String from the external tool shown as QidList
*** This function relays on the existence of a configuration file
*** called mfe.config. This file include one line per tool with two or three
*** keywords:
*** - keyword for the external tool,
*** - batch file to be run
*** - expected file extension for that external tool.
*** Example: 
*** aprove /usr/local/utils/runme .trs
*** othertool /usr/local/utils/runmenow
*** That file is searched in $MAUDE_LIB, the directory where the executable 
*** file is and in the present directory, in that order

*** First parameter: Name of the log file.
*** Second parameter: String to be written to the file.
*** Third parameter: true -> remove previous file content,
***                  false -> append to the previous file content.
*** Result: The message is written to the log file and a String is returned
***         ("ERROR" or "SUCCESS")
