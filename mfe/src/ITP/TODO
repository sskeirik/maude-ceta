Find a proof where I can perform every command (and have it do something):
	- check what happens afterwards
	- this check won't be exhaustive, but it should get most of the cases taken care of

Already Processed:
	- simpMod --> reduces to applyReducePlus
	- applyReducePlus --> tries to go through a formula, simplifying memberships and equalities in very simple ways
	- addOpsITP, addEqsITP, addMbsITP --> just simple module injection functions
	- add-rules --> reduces to addEqsITP, addMbsITP, and addLabelFormulas --- adds LabeledRules to Goal
	- addHypTo --> adds a hypothesis to a module, converts formula to conditional equation or membership
	- addLemTo --> same as addHypTo but marked as lemma instead of hypothesis
	- addLabeledFormulas --> adds known facts to a goal


These are things which need to be checked:
	- equiv-propagate
	- makeNewGoalList, makeChildGoal, makeBrotherGoal, makeTermSplitNewGoalList, makeSplitNewGoalList
	- cov-split-scheme
	- normalize
	- add-named-ctors
	- set-default-ctor


These are unlikely, but still need checking
	- setFormula
